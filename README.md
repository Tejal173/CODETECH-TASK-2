 OBJECTIVES
      The objective of this project is to design and implement a relational database to manage student records efficiently.this inclues maintaining student personal details,course information, and grades while enabling 
  seamless queying and date analysis through SQL joins and other operations.

   KEY ACTIVITIES
       *DATABASE DESIGN 
          --Define the schema for the database,including tables for students,courses and enrollments.
       *TABLES CREATION
          --Create tables in the database with appropriate data types, constrains and relationships.
       *DATA INSERTION
          --Populate tables with sample data to simulate real world scenarios.
       *SQL QUERIES FOR DATA MANAGEMENT
          --Write SQL queries for CRUD(create,read,update,delete) operations.
       *SQL JOINS FOR DATA COMBINATION
           --Use Join operations (IINER JOIN,LEFT JOIN ,ETC) To combine data from multiple tables.
           --write queries to answer complex business questions, such as students performance analysis and course enrollment satistics.
   KEY INSIGHTS
       *UNDERSTANDING  RELATIONAL DATABASE DESIGN
            Learned how to normalize tables and establish relational using primary and foreign keys.

       * DATA RETRIEVAL USING JOINS
            Mastered join operations to combine data from multiple tables and derive meaningful insights.
